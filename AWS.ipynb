    "By creating a cloud computing instance you gain access to a computer in the chosen datacenter. Depending on your requirements, you will be sharing the computer with other users, or, if your business grows, get one or more computers dedicated just to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the `Services` tab in the upper left of the console. You will be presented with a large selection of available services. Choose `EC2` under the `Compute` section. A new page opens with a large blue `Launch Instance` button. Click on it.\n",

Good for us, but this presumably implies that we will not get half the datacenter for ourselves but be sharing a fraction of a single computer with many others. \"Ubuntu\" is a popular flavor of the [\"Linux\" operating system](https://www.linux.org). Other choices on the same page use different versions of Linux and some more specialized setups e.g. for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also get the option between an [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) and an [ARM](https://www.arm.com/) CPU. The former is dominant in desktop and server applications, and ARM is used in most smart phones, tablets and IoT applications. Increasingly there is overlap between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some software is only available on one architecture. For us this is not of much concern; stick with x86, the architecture the lab has been tested with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"Step 2\" you are presented with a table with available computers. Choose a \"Free tier eligible\" type `t2.micro`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the page shows the steps. Zoom ahead from currently \"2. Choose Instance Type\" to \"6. Configure Security Group\" by clicking on the heading.\n",

Leave the type at \"Custom TCP Rule\" but change the port range to`1880`, the standard port used by MQTT. For completeness, enter \"MQTT\" in the \"Description Field\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You get a warning suggesting to limit the IP address range. This feature can be used for example to permit access only from select IP addresses, e.g. those assiged to computers at the university or your company. We won't bother with this feature, but in more critical setups it is a good first line of defense against attacks that can originate anywhere in the world. Click `Review and Launch` and again `Launch`.\n",

    "You will be asked to select or create a key pair. These keys are huge numbers and used for [encryption and identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).\n",

    "Choose \"Create a new key pair\" and give it a name, e.g. \"IoT Weather Station\". Download the keys and store them in a place only you can access and where you will find them again later. You will not be able to access your EC2 instance without these keys. Clicking a blue \"Launch\" button a final time creates the instance. The page also gives you an option to receive alerts if your usage approaches the paying tier. You may want to configure this, just to be safe."

    "5. Click `Create certificate`. This will be used to encrypt all traffic between our device an the cloud and verify the identity of your device (to prevent an attacker from submitting data on your behalf).\n",
    "6. Three files will be created: a public and a private and a certificate. Download them to your computer.\n",
    "7. Click `Attach a policy` followed by `Register Thing`.\n",
    "8. Finally you are presented with the \"Things Page\" which shows the \"Station1\" you just created.\n",
    "9. Now we need to attach a policy to the Thing. In the left navigation pane click `Secure` and then `Policies` followed by `Create a Policy`.\n",
    "10. Give your policy a name and then enter `iot:*` for Action and `*` for Resource ARN. Click the `Allow` box under Effect.\n",
    "11. Click `Create`. The new Policy will be listed under its name on the page that comes up.\n",
    "12. Choose `Manage` from the navigation pane to get back to the Things page. Click on the Thing (Station1). In the navigation pane choose `Security` and click on the certificate we just created. \n",
    "13. In the upper right click on `Actions` and then `Attach Policy`. Choose the checkbox for the policy you created and then click `Attach`. This \"attaches\" the certificate to Thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure is quite a bit more involved than using a public MQTT broker. Most steps have to do with security and are omitted when using an open broker. Judging from relentless messages about security breaches in the press, it makes sense to follow rigorous procedures in all applications."
