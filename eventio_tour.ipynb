    "## Concurrency and Parallel Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it appears as if coroutines run in parallel, only one is active at any given time. This is similar to other computers (laptops, desktops, etc) which give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously but are in fact switching rapidly between different tasks (multi-core processors do run more than one program concurrently). If the processor alternates rapidly e.g. between displaying a movie and a spreadsheet, it appears as if both were running simultaneously, just as the different colored LEDs are blinking concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big difference between the parallel processing of laptop and desktop computers and `eventio` is the approach taken to switching between tasks. The former use a technique known as **\"preemptive multitasking\"**. In this case, the operating system (e.g. Linux or Windows) uses a timer to rapidly (e.g. every 50ms) switch between tasks: The currently running program is temporarily suspended, it's state saved, and a different task is permitted to execute. This process repeats, with each task getting a turn. If a task is current blocked, e.g. waiting for input, it is skipped until it is ready again.\n",
    "\n",
    "With preemptive multitasking, tasks are not aware when execution is interrupted and have no control over when this happens. By contrast, `eventio` uses a different form of task switching called **\"cooperative multitasking\"**. In this scenario, task have full control over when they relinquish the CPU, namely when calling `await`. In other words, a coroutine can be assured that no other task will interrupt it until it signals its \"consent\" with `await`. The duration of the suspension depends on the statement called and the tasks that are waiting. E.g. `await eventio.sleep(1)` suspends the task for at least one second, but could also suspend it for longer if other tasks need the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preemptive and cooperative multitasking have both advantages and drawbacks, and which solution is better depends on the application. For small microcontrollers with limited memory and processing speed, cooperative multitasking is attractive since it generally uses less memory. More significantly, however, is the fact that task switching happens only at well defined instances marked with the keyword `await`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most challenging aspect of parallel processing is ensuring proper use of shared resources. For example, imagine you want to read the value from a sensor over `I2C`. The driver first sends the address of the sensor to get its attention. Then asks the sensor send its value over the bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this sequence is interrupted at an unfortunate moment, by another task, the program may not function as intended. For example, if after addressing the sensor a different task gets control and adresses a different sensor, once control returns to the first task the request to read the sensor data goes to the wrong sensor producing the wrong or no answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such errors are difficult to detect, as they may occur only infrequently and are difficult to reproduce. With cooperative multitasking a task can be assured that it will not be interrupted unless calling `await`. While this simple solution does not address all situations, it substantially reduces the opportunities for errors in concurrent programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main drawback of cooperative multitasking is that a (rouge) task can prevent all others from running. E.g. if in the above example, the call to `eventio.sleep` is replaced by `time.sleep` (and the `await` keyword removed), the first coroutine will run exclusively until it finishes. In a desktop environment this obviously would not be practical - a simple programming mistake could freeze the entire computer. On a microcontroller, however, the entire application is usually under control of a single user who can make sure that this does not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the situation where a coroutine fails to call `await`, either due to a programming error or maliciously, thus preventing other tasks to run, there are a few other errors to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, and most vexing (the kind where everything looks right but still refuses to \"work\") is forgetting the `await` keyword, as in the example below:"
