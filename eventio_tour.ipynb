    "## Concurrency and Parallel Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it appears as if the coroutines run simultaneously, only one is active at any given time. This is similar to other computers (laptops, desktops, etc) which give the appearance of executing several programs concurrently but are in fact switching rapidly between different tasks (multi-core processors do run more than one program at the same time). If the processor alternates rapidly e.g. between playing a movie and a showing edits in a spreadsheet, it appears as if both were running simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big difference between the type of parallel processing used by laptop and desktop computers and `eventio` is the approach taken to switching between tasks. The former use a technique known as **preemptive multitasking**. In this case, the operating system (e.g. Linux or Windows) uses a timer to rapidly (e.g. every 50ms) switch between tasks: The currently running program is temporarily suspended, it's state saved, and a different task is permitted to execute. This process repeats, with each task getting a turn. If a task is blocked, e.g. waiting for input, it is skipped until it is ready again.\n",
    "\n",
    "With preemptive multitasking, tasks are not aware when execution is interrupted and have no control over when this happens. By contrast, `eventio` uses a different form of task switching called **cooperative multitasking**. In this scenario, tasks have full control over when they relinquish the CPU, namely when calling `await`. In other words, a coroutine can be assured that no other task will interrupt it until it signals its \"consent\" with `await`. The duration of the suspension depends on the statement called and the tasks that are waiting. E.g. `await eventio.sleep(1)` suspends the task for at least one second, but could also suspend it for longer if other tasks use the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preemptive and cooperative multitasking have both advantages and drawbacks, and which solution is better depends on the application. For small microcontrollers with limited memory and processing speed, cooperative multitasking is attractive since it uses less memory. More significantly, however, is the fact that task switching happens only at well defined instances marked with the keyword `await`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most challenging aspects of parallel processing is ensuring correct use of shared resources. For example, imagine reading the value from a sensor over `I2C`. The driver first sends the address of the sensor to get its attention. It subsequently asks the sensor return its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this sequence is interrupted at an unfortunate moment by another task, the program may not function as intended. For example, if after addressing the sensor a different task gets control and addresses a sensor at another address, once control returns to the first task the request to read the sensor data goes to the wrong sensor producing an incorrect or no answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of error is very difficult to diagnose, as the error may occur only infrequently and is difficult to reproduce. With cooperative multitasking a task can be assured that it will not be interrupted unless calling `await`. In the above example, it would call `await` only after the sensor read operation has completed. While this does not address all challenges that arise with multitasking, cooperative multitasking substantially reduces the opportunities for errors over the alternative, preemptive multitasking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main drawback of cooperative multitasking is that a (rouge) task can prevent all others from running. E.g. if in the above example, the call to `eventio.sleep` is replaced by `time.sleep` (and the `await` keyword removed), the first coroutine will run exclusively until it finishes. In a desktop environment this obviously would not be practical - a simple programming mistake could freeze the entire computer. Microcontrollers, however, usually run a dedicated application that can be designed and tested for this not to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the situation where a coroutine fails to call `await`, either due to a programming error or maliciously, thus preventing other tasks from running, there are a few other errors to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, and most vexing (the kind where everything _looks right_ but the program still refuses to operate as expected) is forgetting the `await` keyword, as in the example below:"
